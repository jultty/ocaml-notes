## ocaml-notes

Notes on learning OCaml.

If you want to run these Jupyter Notebooks, you can get the [ocaml-jupyter kernel](https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter) to add to your local Jupyter installation or use the `flake.nix` file in this repository if you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed with flake support. For more on the flake implementation check out [jupyenv](https://github.com/tweag/jupyenv).
