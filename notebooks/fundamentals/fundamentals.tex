    \subsection{Installation}\label{installation}

    The official OCaml website has
\href{https://ocaml.org/install}{installation instructions} for several
different platforms. It mostly relies on
\href{https://opam.ocaml.org/}{opam}, a package manager for the OCaml
ecosystem that can also
\href{https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html\#opam-switch}{manage virtual
environments}.

    If you just want to run OCaml code inside Jupyter Notebooks, you can get
the \href{https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter}{ocaml-jupyter kernel}
to add it to your local Jupyter installation or use the
\texttt{flake.nix} file in this repository if you have
\href{https://nixos.org/}{Nix} installed with flake support. For more on
the flake implementation check out
\href{https://github.com/tweag/jupyenv}{jupyenv}.

    \subsection{Running OCaml code}\label{running-ocaml-code}

    OCaml files (extension \texttt{.ml}), can be compiled to bytecode
executables using \texttt{ocamlc} or native executables using
\texttt{ocamlopt}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{ocamlc}\NormalTok{ hello.ml }\AttributeTok{{-}o}\NormalTok{ hello}
\ExtensionTok{ocamlopt}\NormalTok{ hello }\AttributeTok{{-}o}\NormalTok{ hello\_native}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Bytecode executables are more portable across different platforms, while
native executables have improved performance at the cost of little
portability, longer compile time and increased filesizes.

    If you want to use a REPL to evaluate code directly as you would do in a
shell, you probably want
\href{https://github.com/ocaml-community/utop}{utop}, which is also
available through opam.

    One last way of running OCaml code that is worth mentioning is in
scripts. You can for instance write a file called \texttt{script.ml}
with the following shebang:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#!/usr/bin/env ocaml}

\BuiltInTok{let} \ErrorTok{(}\KeywordTok{)} \ExtensionTok{=}\NormalTok{ print\_endline }\StringTok{"Hello, OCaml"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Supposing you are in a Linux-based system, you could then add execution
permissions with \texttt{chmod\ +x\ script.ml} and you can now run this
file with \texttt{./script.ml}. In this case, the \texttt{.ml} file
extension is optional.

    \subsection{Basic syntax}\label{basic-syntax}

    \subsubsection{Binding}\label{binding}

    In OCaml, what would usually called variables are actually all
constants.

The \texttt{=} operator can be used for binding a value to an identifier
with the \texttt{let} keyword, but otherwise it will test for equality
rather than reassigning.

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{1}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{u} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{8} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{n}{u} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{9}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{1}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val u : int = 8

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{1}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = false

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    If mutation is intended, you can either shadow or use \texttt{ref}:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{2}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{u} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{7}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{2}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val u : int = 7

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{3}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{r} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{ref} \PY{l+m+mi}{19} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{n}{r}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{3}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val r : int ref = \{contents = 19\}

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{3}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int ref = \{contents = 19\}

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    The content of a reference can be dereferrenced with \texttt{!}:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{4}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{o}{!}\PY{n}{r}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{4}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = 19

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    To update a reference, the \texttt{:=} operator is used:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{5}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{r} \PY{o}{:=} \PY{o}{!}\PY{n}{r} \PY{o}{+} \PY{l+m+mi}{1} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{n}{r}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{5}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : unit = ()

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{5}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int ref = \{contents = 20\}

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \begin{quote}
This returns \texttt{()} because changing the content of a reference is
a side-effect. (A Tour of OCaml)
\end{quote}

    \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{in}}{in}}\label{in}

    The \texttt{in} keyword can be used to use a given assignment only
within a limited scope:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{6}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{z} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{4} \PY{k}{in} \PY{n}{z} \PY{o}{*} \PY{n}{z} \PY{o}{*} \PY{n}{z} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{n}{z}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{6}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = 64

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, frame=single, framerule=2mm, rulecolor=\color{outerrorbackground}]
File "[6]", line 3, characters 0-1:
3 | z
    \^{}
Error: Unbound value z

    \end{Verbatim}

    Now for a more complicated example:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{7}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{a} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{500} \PY{k}{in} \PY{o}{(}\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{b} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{a} \PY{o}{*} \PY{n}{a} \PY{k}{in} \PY{n}{a} \PY{o}{+} \PY{n}{b}\PY{o}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{7}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = 250500

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    In the example above, \texttt{let\ b\ =\ a\ *\ a\ in\ a\ +\ b} is within
parenthesis for clarity, but the same expression without parenthesis
evaluates to the same value:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{8}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{a} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{500} \PY{k}{in} \PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{b} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{a} \PY{o}{*} \PY{n}{a} \PY{k}{in} \PY{n}{a} \PY{o}{+} \PY{n}{b}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{8}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = 250500

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    The expression between parenthesis will resolve \texttt{b} to the square
of \texttt{a} and then add \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}. As \texttt{a} was
defined to 500, we have:

    \[
    \ \\
    a = 500 \\
    b = a^2 \\
    x = a + b \\
    x = 500 + 500^2 \\
    x = 250500 \\
\]

    \subsubsection{Types and operators}\label{types-and-operators}

    OCaml has type inferrence, but types can also be explicitly declared:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{9}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{i} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{3}
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{f} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{3}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{9}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val i : int = 3

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{9}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val f : float = 3.

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{10}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{c}\PY{o}{:} \PY{k+kt}{char} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{7}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{9}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, frame=single, framerule=2mm, rulecolor=\color{outerrorbackground}]
File "[10]", line 1, characters 14-17:
1 | let c: char = 7.9
                  \^{}\^{}\^{}
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         char

    \end{Verbatim}

    The operators are similar to other programming languages I am familiar
with:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{11}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{l+m+mi}{2} \PY{o}{+} \PY{l+m+mi}{2} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{4} \PY{o}{;;}
\PY{l+m+mi}{3} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{3} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{o}{;;}
\PY{l+m+mi}{1} \PY{o}{+} \PY{l+m+mi}{6} \PY{o}{*} \PY{l+m+mi}{2} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{13} \PY{o}{;;}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{11}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{11}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{11}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    If you divide integers, you will not get a float:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{12}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{l+m+mi}{3} \PY{o}{/} \PY{l+m+mi}{2} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{1}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{12}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Logical operators are also similar to most other languages I am familiar
with, except for the \texttt{\textless{}\textgreater{}} operator used
for non-equality and the fact that a single \texttt{=} can be used for
equality:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{13}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{o}{(}\PY{l+m+mi}{2} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{2}\PY{o}{)} \PY{o}{\PYZam{}\PYZam{}} \PY{o}{(}\PY{l+m+mi}{3} \PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{o}{)} \PY{o}{\PYZam{}\PYZam{}} \PY{o}{(}\PY{l+m+mi}{5} \PY{o}{\PYZlt{}}\PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{5}\PY{o}{)} \PY{o}{\PYZam{}\PYZam{}} \PY{o}{(}\PY{l+m+mi}{3} \PY{o}{\PYZlt{}}\PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{o}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{13}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \textbf{Unlike} most languages I know, OCaml is strict about what types
each operator is able to handle.

It will \emph{not} make its best attempt when passed expresions such as:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{14}{\boxspacing}

    For operations between floats you want to use \texttt{+.}, \texttt{-.},
\texttt{*.} and \texttt{/.} instead:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{18}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{o}{(}\PY{l+m+mi}{7}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0001} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}.} \PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0001} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{14}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{o}{/.} \PY{l+m+mi}{2}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{o}{)} \PY{o}{=} \PY{o}{(}\PY{l+m+mi}{6}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{o}{+}\PY{o}{.} \PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{3}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{5} \PY{o}{*}\PY{o}{.} \PY{l+m+mi}{2}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{o}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{18}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    I really like the way OCaml behaves here compared to many of the
languages I studied, either with and without static typing and type
inferrence, where all sorts of nonsense can happen due to operations
involving different types being handled through implicit conversions.

    However, you can still use comparison between chars:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{19}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{l+s+sc}{\PYZsq{}a\PYZsq{}} \PY{o}{\PYZlt{}} \PY{l+s+sc}{\PYZsq{}z\PYZsq{}} \PY{o}{\PYZam{}\PYZam{}} \PY{l+s+sc}{\PYZsq{}@\PYZsq{}} \PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+s+sc}{\PYZsq{}\PYZam{}\PYZsq{}}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{19}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    In fact, the \texttt{\textless{}} and \texttt{\textgreater{}} operators
seem to be more flexible in this regard, also allowing for instance:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{20}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n+nb+bp}{true} \PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{n+nb+bp}{false}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{20}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{21}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{a string}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}} \PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{another}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{21}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = false

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Still, it won't compare integers and floats:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{22}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{l+m+mi}{2} \PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{0}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, frame=single, framerule=2mm, rulecolor=\color{outerrorbackground}]
File "[22]", line 1, characters 4-7:
1 | 2 > 1.0
        \^{}\^{}\^{}
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int

    \end{Verbatim}

    The special keywords \texttt{max\_int} and \texttt{min\_int} evaluate to
the corresponding minimal and maximum integer values possible:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{23}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{max\PYZus{}int} \PY{o}{;;}
\PY{n}{min\PYZus{}int} \PY{o}{;;}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{23}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = 4611686018427387903

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{23}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = -4611686018427387904

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    If they are exceeded, they will wrap to their opposite:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{24}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{max\PYZus{}int} \PY{o}{+} \PY{l+m+mi}{1} \PY{o}{;;}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = -4611686018427387904

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Therefore, we can say that:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{25}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{25}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \subsubsection{Flow control}\label{flow-control}

    As shown in the previous example where the integer value \texttt{0} was
passed to an \texttt{if}, conditional structures are expressions in
OCaml, meaning they can return values:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{26}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{l+m+mi}{2} \PY{o}{*} \PY{k}{if} \PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{hello}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{world}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}} \PY{k}{then} \PY{l+m+mi}{3} \PY{k}{else} \PY{l+m+mi}{5}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{26}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = 10

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Note that the whole expression must evaluate to the same type. In this
example that wil be determined by the first type in the expression:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{27}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{=} \PY{k}{if} \PY{l+m+mi}{100} \PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{99} \PY{k}{then} \PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{1} \PY{k}{else} \PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{n}{x}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, frame=single, framerule=2mm, rulecolor=\color{outerrorbackground}]
File "[27]", line 1, characters 34-35:
1 | let x = if 100 > 99 then 0.1 else 0 ;;
                                      \^{}
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
         float
  Hint: Did you mean `0.'?

    \end{Verbatim}

    In the example above, the \texttt{0.1} value causes the \texttt{1} value
to be considered wrong by the compiler as it doesn't match the type of
the first value, \texttt{0.1}, a float.

    Conversely, if we invert their positions, the compiler now emits an
error on the second value not being an integer:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{28}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{=} \PY{k}{if} \PY{l+m+mi}{100} \PY{o}{\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{99} \PY{k}{then} \PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{k}{else} \PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{o}{.}\PY{l+m+mi}{1} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{n}{x}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, frame=single, framerule=2mm, rulecolor=\color{outerrorbackground}]
File "[28]", line 1, characters 32-35:
1 | let x = if 100 > 99 then 0 else 0.1 ;;
                                    \^{}\^{}\^{}
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int

    \end{Verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Functions}\label{functions}

    This function takes \texttt{x} as an argument and returns \(x^3\):

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{29}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{cube} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{*} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{*} \PY{n}{x}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{29}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val cube : int -> int = <fun>

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Notice how the interpreter response is stating \texttt{cube} is a value,
printing it's signature of taking an integer and returning an integer
(\texttt{int\ -\textgreater{}\ int}) and that it is a function.

    So if we run cube on the number 4:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{30}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{cube} \PY{l+m+mi}{4}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{30}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int = 64

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Because \texttt{if} structures are expressions, they can be the body of
a function:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{31}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{neg} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{=} \PY{k}{if} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{\PYZlt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{k}{then} \PY{n+nb+bp}{true} \PY{k}{else} \PY{n+nb+bp}{false}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{31}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val neg : int -> bool = <fun>

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    However, the above function could be simplified to:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{32}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{neg} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{x} \PY{o}{\PYZlt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{0}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{32}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val neg : int -> bool = <fun>

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Calling the function with a negative value requires having it inside
parenthesis:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{33}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{neg} \PY{o}{(}\PY{o}{\PYZhy{}}\PY{l+m+mi}{30}\PY{o}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{33}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : bool = true

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Whitington explains this as ``We added parentheses to distinguish from
neg - 30'', but I did not really understand what was meant by that.

    The error message is:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{34}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{neg} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}}\PY{l+m+mi}{30}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, frame=single, framerule=2mm, rulecolor=\color{outerrorbackground}]

    \end{Verbatim}

    Functions with multiple parameters are possible and look just as you
would expect from looking at the single-parameter ones:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\PY{n}{add} \PY{l+m+mi}{8} \PY{l+m+mi}{12}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    Notice how the signature returned by the interpreter looks like a
curried function.

    Recursive functions must use the \texttt{rec} keyword, otherwise the
recursion call will state the function is unbound:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]

  4 * (3 * (2 * 1))

\texttt{{[}{]}} and is of undertermined type \(\alpha\)
(\texttt{\textquotesingle{}a}).

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    All non-empty lists have a head (its first element) and a tail. A list
with a single element has this element as its head and \texttt{{[}{]}}
as its tail.

    The \emph{cons} operator, \texttt{::} , adds a single element to the
front of the list:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{45}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{l+m+mi}{0} \PY{o}{::} \PY{n}{l}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{45}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
- : int list = [0; 1; 2; 3]

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    The \emph{append} operator, \texttt{@} , combines two lists together:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{46}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{m} \PY{o}{=} \PY{o}{[} \PY{l+m+mi}{4}\PY{o}{;} \PY{l+m+mi}{5}\PY{o}{;} \PY{l+m+mi}{6}\PY{o}{;} \PY{o}{]} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{k}{let} \PY{n}{n} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{l} \PY{o}{@} \PY{n}{m}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{46}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val m : int list = [4; 5; 6]

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{46}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val n : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]

\end{Verbatim}

    \begin{quote}
The argument has type α list (which OCaml prints on the screen as
\texttt{’a} list) because this function does not inspect the individual
elements of the list, it just checks if the list is empty. And so, this
function can operate over any type of list.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The greek letters α, β, γ etc. stand for any type. If two types are
represented by the same greek letter they must have the same type. If
they are not, they may have the same type, but do not have to. Functions
like this are known as polymorphic. (Whitington)
\end{quote}

    The \texttt{::} operator can be used in pattern matching to deconstruct
a list where in \texttt{h::t} you will obtain the head of the list
assigned to \texttt{h} and the tail to \texttt{t}.:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\prompt{In}{incolor}{48}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{let} \PY{k+kt}{list} \PY{o}{=} \PY{o}{[} \PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{o}{;} \PY{l+m+mi}{2}\PY{o}{;} \PY{l+m+mi}{3}\PY{o}{;} \PY{o}{]} \PY{o}{;;}

\PY{k}{let} \PY{k}{rec} \PY{n}{length} \PY{n}{l} \PY{o}{=}
  \PY{k}{match} \PY{n}{l} \PY{k}{with}
    \PY{n+nb+bp}{[]} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{0}
  \PY{o}{|} \PY{o}{\PYZus{}}\PY{o}{::}\PY{n}{t} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}\PYZgt{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{1} \PY{o}{+} \PY{n}{length} \PY{n}{t}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{48}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
            \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=.5pt, pad at break*=1mm, opacityfill=0]
\prompt{Out}{outcolor}{48}{\boxspacing}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
val length : 'a list -> int = <fun>

\end{Verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
        
    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]

    The above evaluates as follows:
    length [ 1; 2; 3; ]
=>  1 + length [ 2; 3; ]
=>  1 + (1 + length [3])
=>  1 + (1 + (1 + length []))
=>  1 + (1 + (1 + 0))
=>  1 + (1 + 1)
=>  1 + 2
=>  3
